I love the variety of shapes, colors, textures, and facial expressions.”</p><p>The Postal Service ordered a large initial print run of 400 million Pets stamps, a sign, perhaps, that USPS officials expect the Pets stamps to be popular with the stamp-buying public.</p><p>That earlier set was so popular that the initial print run of 300 stamps was bolstered by a second printing of 91.4 million stamps announced six months after the stamps were first issued.</p><p>The new Pets stamps feature a well-rounded selection of domesticated animals, including two cats and two dogs, two birds, two fish, four reptiles, six rodents, a horse and a hermit crab.</p><p>Animals have always been popular with topical stamp collectors, and dogs, cats and birds are among the favorite subjects. Pets are also popular with the American public, according to the Postal Service, with more than half of U.S. homes having at least one pet.</p><p>“The most common pets are dogs and cats,” the Postal Service noted. “These furry, four-legged family members have long provided love, friendship, and sometimes protection for their owners.”</p><p>The digital color first-day postmark for the Pets issue features silhouette images of six different animals, each in a bold, solid color: horse, goldfish, snake, dog, cat, and parrot. This postmark is used on certain uncacheted first-day covers sold in a set of 20 by the Postal Service.</p><p>Press sheets consisting of 160 stamps (eight panes of 20) are being offered as well.

Taken from above, the photo captures the beauty of the green leaves, the red bracts, and the yellow flowers in the center of the plant.</p><p>The poinsettia—Euphorbia pulcherrima—is a small tropical tree that can reach heights of more than 10 feet in the wild in its native Mexico. We tend to think of the beautifully colored “petals” as the flowers, but in fact, those are the modified leaves called bracts. The poinsettia’s flower is the cluster of small, yellow, cup-shaped structures in the center of the leaves.</p><p>Revered by the Aztec, the poinsettia was considered a symbol of purity. They used the bracts to make dye and cosmetics and created medicine for fever from the plant’s sap. During the 17th century, European priests observed that the plant bloomed during the winter months and incorporated it into festivals to celebrate the Nativity.</p><p>The plant was named in honor of Dr. Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first American ambassador to Mexico, who sent cuttings of the exotic plant back to the U.S. in the early years of the 19th century. National Poinsettia Day is observed on December 12, the day that Dr. Poinsett died.</p><p>Introduced to the American gardening public in 1829 at the first exhibition of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society—now known as the Philadelphia Flower Show—the vivid red plant soon became associated with the holidays in the United States. Growers in California are credited with the 20th-century explosion in popularity and availability of the poinsettia, which continues today.</p><p>The poinsettia has more than 100 varieties, though red is still America’s favorite. Modern plants are bred in many other hues including pink, apricot, yellow, cream, and white. In addition, there are unusual varieties that blend several colors in speckled or marbled patterns.</p><p>Poinsettias are now as much a part of the holidays as evergreens and mistletoe; tens of millions of plants are sold during the season.</p><p>The art director was William J.

The stamps were issued at a First Day of Issue stamp dedication ceremony held in the A.R. & Marylouise Tandy Floral Terraces at the Tulsa Botanic Garden today.</p><p>“I can’t think of a better place for the United States Postal Service to unveil a collection of stamps to celebrate one of nature’s unique and colorful wonderments,” said Steven Phelps, acting vice president, Pricing and Costing, U.S. Postal Service. “Although much of nature’s bold imagery gets muted by winter’s cold temperatures and snowfall, the four colorful berries that we are highlighting on our new stamps are sure to help brighten the season.”</p><p>The Winter Berries Stamps art features highly detailed botanical portraits of each plant that highlight the bold colors and rich textures of their berries. Artist Steve Buchanan worked with Art Director Antonio Alcalá to create these four new stamps.</p><p>Barbara Sturdivant, chair, Tulsa Botanic Garden Board of Directors, and Todd Lasseigne, president and CEO, Tulsa Botanic Garden, joined Phelps in the ceremony, along with Raymond Red Corn, assistant principal chief, Osage Nation.</p><p>The Winter Berries booklet of 20 stamps are being issued as Forever stamps, meaning they will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail 1-ounce price.</p><h3>Stamps Pattern Background</h3><p>Stamps Pattern: The Winterberry. Seen throughout the eastern United States, the common winterberry sports dense clumps of small red berries on its bare branches in the winter. A variety of deciduous holly, this attractive shrub loses all of its leaves after the first frost. The winterberry can grow up to 15 feet tall and is a popular addition to yards and gardens. In the winter, its bright fruit becomes a valuable food source for many small mammals and more than 45 species of birds.</p><p>Stamps Pattern: The Juniper Berry. Native to most of the United States and Canada, the common juniper produces seeds that are not quite what they seem. The blackish-blue berries that adorn the juniper’s evergreen branches are actually small conifer cones. With tightly merged scales and a fleshy appearance, the seeds resemble, and are commonly referred to as, berries. Their bold color and distinctive, astringent flavor make them irresistible for a variety of birds and even some humans.</p><p>Stamps Pattern: The Beautyberry. Perhaps the most aptly named of nature’s fruiting plants, the American beautyberry is a vivid sight throughout the southeastern United States. In late summer, small purple berries begin to grow in rounded clusters along the shrub’s drooping branches. Popular with many varieties of birds, the berries get snatched up in autumn with some persisting through winter. A native perennial, the beautyberry grows well in lush environments and can reach a height of eight feet. Its attractive berries and vigor make it a favorite for many gardeners.</p><p>Stamps Pattern: The Soapberry. Named for the sudsy froth produced by a compound found in its fruit, the soapberry tree can grow as tall as 50 feet. Sometimes called western or wingleaf soapberry, this deciduous tree bears golden yellow berries in the fall that remain throughout the winter. Though poisonous to consume, the berries have been used to make soap in various tropical regions around the world. In the United States, soapberry grows across the southern half of the country, from Arizona to South Carolina.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

However, the symbol’s connection to love is very clear, as the heart is where people believe feelings reside.

The digitally created stamp design shows a red, white and blue ribbon crisply folded into a star shape. The white space remaining in the center also creates a star, amplifying the patriotic effect. The white space in the middle of the ribbon creates a second smaller star. The words “Forever” and “USA” appear below the star.</p><p>Patriotic symbols were used as design elements on United States postage stamps as far back as 1869, when the 10¢ yellow stamp issued that year showed an eagle with spreading wings perched upon a striped shield.</p><p>“The tricolored ribbon, folded into a patriotic symbol, is intended to evoke the connectedness of the American people,” according to the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>The self-adhesive stamp will be issued in panes of 20, coils of 3,000 and coils of 10,000.</p><p>Technical details for the coils have not been released, but if the same printer created both coil sizes, it is likely the coil stamps will be the same regardless of the source.

The species shown were Engelmann’s prickly pear, fire crown, Texas rainbow, dahlia, scarlet hedgehog, hatchet, golden Tom Thumb, eagle’s claw, glory of Texas, and silver ball. They are just a handful of the many cacti that produce beautiful flowers.</p><p>Each Cactus Flowers Forever stamp depicts the floral display of one of these ten cacti: Opuntia engelmannii, Rebutia minuscula, Echinocereus dasyacanthus, Echinocereus poselgeri, Echinocereus coccineus, Pelecyphora aselliformis, Parodia microsperma, Echinocactus horizonthalonius, Thelocactus heterochromus and Parodia scopa. Cacti also may have common names, with some varieties having several different names in popular use.</p><h3>Stamp Pattern Background</h3><p>Cactus flowers generally occur singly, although many separate blossoms might appear on a plant at the same time. Flowering occurs at different times of the year and even different times of the day or night. Most cactus flowers are large and flamboyant, with colors of white, red, pink, orange or yellow.</p><p>“The U.S. Postal Service has a long history of celebrating Earth’s floral diversity,” said Postal Service acting Manager of Operations and Support for the Western Area John DiPeri during the stamp’s first-day-of-issue dedication ceremony today. “Cacti in bloom have been described as Mother Nature’s fireworks. Their reds, pinks, yellows and violets bring to life a plant synonymous with an environment where few living things thrive.”</p><p>The ceremony was held in conjunction with the AmeriStamp Expo at the Mesa Convention Center, where DiPeri was joined by William J. Gicker, the Postal Service’s acting director of Stamp Services, and Ken Schultz, executive director of the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, AZ.</p><p>The cactus flowers stamps are being issued in booklets of 20. These cactus flowers stamps will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail 1-ounce price. Within the booklet, each stamp design is featured twice. Art Director Ethel Kessler designed the stamps with existing photographs taken by John P. Schaefer.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

This heart-filled design is just right for thank-you notes, get-well cards or any occasion when love is the perfect message. A dedication ceremony for the stamp was held today at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.</p><p>“While issued in time for Valentine’s Day, these Made of Hearts Stamp need no special holiday,” said David E. Williams, USPS chief operating officer and executive vice president. “Used as an expression of friendship, romance, encouragement, or simply ‘thinking of you,’ the Made of Hearts stamp will deliver your message in style.”</p><p>Stamp Pattern Background</p><p>The connection between sentiment and the heart symbol is at least as old as the ancient Greeks. Images of ivy, grape and fig leaves — all shaped like the heart — were crafted in art and on pottery to symbolize abiding love. Use of the heart as an expression of romantic constancy is also reflected in the concept of courtly love that was the fashion in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Today, the heart is used to signify more than romantic or eternal love. Hearts are featured in many slogans that denote a love of place and in the logo designs of many businesses and organizations. A favorite motif in art, hearts are design elements frequently found on stamp, furniture, jewelry, textiles, shoes and clothing. The heart is universally understood to symbolize devotion, affection and love.</p><p>The first USPS Love stamp was issued in 1973. “Made of Hearts” 2020 stamps features horizontal lines of red and pink hearts on a white background. Toward the center, red hearts in varying sizes replace pink hearts in a formation that creates one large red heart, the focal point of this graphic design.</p><p>Beyond romantic messages, the Made of Hearts Stamp is intended for use on thank-you notes, get-well cards or any occasion when love is the perfect message.

stamp1014,U.S. 2021 Wild Orchids Framed Booklet,U.S. 2021 Wild Orchids Framed Booklet,"<p>CORAL GABLES, FL — The U.S. Postal Service celebrates the striking beauty of wild orchids with the release of the Wild Orchids Forever stamps. Part of the largest family of plants on Earth, orchids grow in many climates and thrive under a variety of conditions.</p><p>The stamps were dedicated at the American Orchid Society Library at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, Coral Gables, FL.</p><p>Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamps with photographs taken by James A. Fowler.</p><p>North America is home to approximately 200 native orchid species. They grow wild across the country and can be hard to spot, especially in swamps, bogs, and wetlands.</p><p>In 2020, the United States Postal Service issued a set of 10 new Forever stamps picturing wild orchids of America. Each is a beautiful wildflower most people do not get the opportunity to see. They are all hard to find today.</p><h3>Stamps Background</h3><p>All orchid species are vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. This is because they depend on specific animals and fungi to survive. Most species are found only in wetlands, which are quickly disappearing. One organization working to protect and restore native orchids is the North American Orchid Conservation Center. It is jointly operated by the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and the US Botanic Garden. With their nationwide work, there is hope for our native wild orchids yet.</p><p>It may be tempting to dig up a wild orchid, but this is the last thing you should do. They are very sensitive to change, and in order to preserve them for future generations, it is important to look, not touch. You will appreciate the beauty and wonder of wild orchids even more knowing the only way to enjoy them is by getting out and exploring nature.</p><p>“Orchids can be hard to find in a natural setting and today there is a conservation effort to preserve these beautiful flowers,” said Jakki Krage Strako, chief customer and marketing officer and executive vice president, U.S. Postal Service, who served as the event’s dedicating official. “Each of these stamps represent a masterpiece of nature that blossoms with color. They also continue the Postal Service tradition of showcasing the natural beauty of flowers on stamps.”</p><p>Joining Strako to dedicate the stamps were Georgia Tasker, author, horticulture writer and Pulitzer Prize finalist; Susan Wedegaertner, president, American Orchid Society; photographer James A. Fowler; and Lawrence Zettler, director of the orchid recovery program, Illinois College.</p><p>“Orchids are the world’s most familiar group of flowers and these charming stamps showcase nine of the over 200 orchid species native to the United States,” said Zettler. “These stamps also serve as a reminder of their beauty and their vulnerability.”</p><p>Each stamp features a photograph of one of these nine species: Cypripedium californicum, Hexalectris spicata, Cypripedium reginae, Spiranthes odorata, Triphora trianthophoros, Platanthera grandiflora, Cyrtopodium polyphyllum, Calopogon tuberosus and Platanthera leucophaea. The booklet contains 10 stamp designs and each design is featured twice for a total of 20 stamps. Triphora tranthophoros is featured on two stamps designs, to include the booklet cover.</p><p>The Wild Orchids stamps will also be issued in coils of 3,000 and 10,000.<br />There are more than 30,000 species of wild orchids in the world. Many that are native to North America are endangered or threatened, making sightings in their natural environment increasingly rare.</p><p>These striking flowers are native to damp woodlands, and numerous organizations across the country are working to preserve orchid habitats. Orchids also thrive in cultivated gardens or as houseplants.</p><p>“It’s amazing that my passions of photographing wild orchids and stamp collecting have converged today with the release of these stamps,” said Fowler. “My childhood interest in photography began on the knee of my mother, who was an accomplished photographer; my passion for the beauty of plants, I learned from my great-grandmother, who was a botanist at the Department of Agriculture; and the hobby of stamp collecting, I picked up from my older brother.”</p><p>The Wild Orchids stamps are being issued as Forever stamps, which will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail 1-ounce price.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

The wedding roses stamps features two beautiful white roses to ensure that your wedding correspondence will be remembered.</p><h3>Stamps Pattern Background</h3><p>Suitors introduced the rose as a symbol of love in the Victorian Era. Strict rules of conduct made it impossible for smitten young men to express their emotions verbally. A “language of flowers” developed, which allowed lovers to communicate sentiments by the type, color, and number of flowers they gave one another.</p><p>The gift of red roses is a declaration of love, while pink roses convey sweetness, grace, and poetic romance. White roses carried on a bride’s wedding day signify eternal love, purity, and innocence.</p><p>According to tradition, long-stemmed roses are an expression of love and devotion. They represent love that is deep and long-lasting. Because the number twelve represents a complete cycle, a dozen roses are the symbol of complete love. Since there are 24 hours in a day, two dozen roses signify complete devotion each moment of every day. So it’s a special way to send a message of love to use the stamps with the wedding roses.</p><p>Brand new, 1 sheets of 20 first class stamps (20 total stamps).<br />Forever stamps are always equal in value to the current first-class mail one-ounce rate.<br />Features wedding roses design.<br />Great for weddings, invitations, and other mailings.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

Educators, health care professionals, and policymakers can all play a role in addressing drug use through prevention and early intervention.</p><p>National Recovery Month, observed annually in September, raises awareness about the effectiveness of substance use disorder treatment and mental health services and serves as an important reminder that recovery is possible.

The new Earth Day stamps marks five decades of Americans coming together to celebrate the importance of protecting the environment. The Earth Day Stamps will be available for sale nationwide on April 18.</p><p>The Postal Service has canceled the first-day-of-issue ceremony for the Earth Day stamp due to social distancing guidance.</p><p>On the first Earth Day in 1970, millions of people across America joined to rally against pollution. The event quickly developed into an annual tradition. As time passed, educating children about the environment became a priority, with the annual celebration also providing an opportunity for businesses to showcase new goods and services that are mindful of the environment.</p><p>Today, Earth Day remains a high-profile day for people around the world to recognize the importance of the planet and the impact of their environmental footprint. The Earth Day Forever stamp is a reminder for both senders and recipients that we share the atmosphere on our planet.</p><p>The Earth Day stamps is being issued in booklets of 20 stamps. Art director Antonio Alcalá created the painting of Earth, using gouache on watercolor paper. The design features small green lines surrounding the blue planet.

This Earth Day Stamps will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail 1-ounce price.</p><h3>Source of Stamp Background</h3><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, as the dangers of pollution were becoming a common concern, a groundswell of support began for a day to celebrate the planet. It gained further traction in 1969 after what was then the largest oil spill in U.S. history occurred off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA.</p><p>Soon after the spill, Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D-WI), a conservationist who championed legislation to protect natural resources, resolved to unite the nation around environmental causes. Senator Nelson inspired thousands of people to organize environmental teach-ins at universities, schools and community centers around the country. April 22, between college spring break and finals, was chosen as the date for a national observance.</p><p>Among these politicians was Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson. Nelson had witnessed the effects of the Santa Barbara oil spill and wanted to do something to prevent future horrors. At the time, American schools were a hotbed for anti-war protests. He believed that if he could harness that same enthusiasm for the rising interest in air and water pollution, he could make environmental protection a part of the national political agenda.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

Barns have deep roots in American culture, reflecting the heritage of generations who worked the land.</p><p>The construction of many older barns required individuals with the skills to lay the foundation, to cut the timbers, to raise the frame, and to sheath and roof the structures. Built to last, these historic farm buildings still dot our rural landscape.</p><p>Today, there are ongoing efforts to preserve barns in America, from national and state organizations to local groups working to save specific buildings. Many barns are being maintained or adapted to continue their original purpose of housing animals and equipment and for storage. Others are finding new life as houses, offices, entertainment spaces, or even as wedding venues.</p><p>Whatever their modern function might be, historic barns represent America’s heritage. From the timber frames to the stone foundations, the materials and craftsmanship that went into constructing these barns tell the story of the importance of agriculture in building our country.</p><p>Ashley Walton designed the stamps with original artwork by Kim Johnson.

From upper left and moving clockwise, they depict an otter poking its head—seen in three-quarters profile—from the surface of an icy body of water; an otter sliding on its back, tail first, down a snowbank; an otter chest-deep in a snow drift, facing the viewer; and another otter sliding down a snowbank. In the stationary poses, snow clings to the otters’ fur. In the views showing motion, small snowballs race the otters downhill.</p><p>A denizen of riparian areas throughout most of the United States and Canada, this elegantly long and sleek mammal (Lontra canadensis) is designed for life in and around the water. Besides webbed feet, it has a muscular tail, about 40 percent of its entire body length, that powers it in swimming and diving. Otters may look a bit awkward when walking, but they are nothing but graceful as they twist and loop through the water, slide down snowbanks, or frolic in the fluffy white stuff. When they glide across ice to get to an opening and dive into the water below, it is because they depend on river creatures for their winter diet. We may shiver at the thought, but their dense double-layered coats insulate them against the winter cold and keep them from freezing.</p><p>Art director Derry Noyes designed the stamps with artwork from illustrator John Burgoyne. The <strong><i>Otters in Snow</i></strong> stamps are being issued as Forever® stamps. These Forever stamps will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail® one-ounce rate.</p><p>Made in the USA.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

Featuring highly stylized digital portraits, the stamp art depicts four types of stony corals with associated reef fish: elkhorn coral, shown with two French angelfish; brain coral, with a spotted moray eel; staghorn coral, with bluestriped grunts; pillar coral, with a coney grouper and neon gobies.</p><p>Coral reefs are formed over thousands of years mainly by colonies of animals called polyps. Polyps make stony corals, the foundation for most coral reefs, by secreting protective skeletons of calcium carbonate, or limestone. As these limestone skeletons accumulate over time – with new colonies of polyps growing on top of the skeletons of older ones – they build up the base of coral reefs.</p><p>Coral reefs are one of the world’s most marvelous ecosystems, sheltering and sustaining about a quarter of all ocean species. Anyone who has snorkeled in tropical environments has witnessed the sea come alive when approaching a coral reef. Suddenly an abundance of fish of all types and colors appear, along with a variety of other animals and plants, including sea urchins, seagrass, octopuses, and lobsters.</p><p>The Postal Service has revealed a black pictorial first-day cancel for the new Coral Reefs stamps. The postmark includes the phrase “Coral Reefs” in large letters across the bottom, with a silhouette of a sea plant growing out from between the two words.</p><p>Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamps.

These festive holiday contemporary stamps represent one of the major issues for the 2016 holiday mailing season.</p><p>“These new stamps will help people celebrate the holidays with style – whether applied to letters, cards or packages, they will welcome recipients with greetings and good cheer,” Postal Service Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Joseph Corbett noted. “It’s our hope that these inviting stamps will help customers connect with the festive spirit of the season.”</p><p>These new stamps have been printed – and will be sold – only as complete booklets of 20 stamps, priced at $9.40 (the individual stamp price is 47 cents). The booklets feature four designs that each appears five times.</p><p>The stamps reflect the simple pleasures of the wintry holiday season and feature a candle, a wreath, a star and a lighted tree. The stamps show the tranquil calm of a winter evening after the snow has fallen and the sun has set. Whether you enjoy viewing a peaceful scene from a cozy spot indoors or feeling a chill on your face outside, these brief moments make this time of year special.</p><p>Two designs show views from the inside looking out: a single burning candle sits on a window sill; and a simple star ornament hangs in a window. Two other designs show views from the outside looking in: a brightly lit indoor Christmas tree contrasts with the snowy shrubs outside; and a snow-covered wreath hangs in front of a frosted window. Art director Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, MD, designed the stamps with original artwork by William Low of Huntington, NY.</p><p>Featuring snowy winter nights, these stamps demonstrate how windows everywhere play a role in the celebration of the holidays. We can delight in the snow when we’re inside, and can share our warmth and happiness with the outside world through simple panes of glass. Conveying both the joyful and the reverent spirit of the holiday season, these elegant stamps show the ways we observe traditions and spread cheer. Each stamp is sure to add some winter joy to letters and cards during the year’s coldest months, especially in regions farther north.</p><p>With four warm, inviting illustrations of winter scenes featuring windows, the Holiday Windows stamps rejoice in the simple pleasures of the season. Two stamp designs show views from the inside looking out: a single burning candle sits on a sill and a simple star ornament hangs from a hook attached to the window sash, out of sight. Two other stamp designs show views from the outside looking in: a brightly lit Christmas tree contrasts with the snowy shrubs on the other side of the glass and a snow-covered wreath hangs in front of frosted windowpanes.</p><p>The Holiday Windows stamps are being issued as Forever stamps.

He is adjusting his eyeglasses with his left hand, while holding an open green book with the title Good Boys & Girls in his right hand.</p><p>The designs of the stamps and the souvenir sheet are each derived from archived artwork produced by Haddon Sundblom for the Coca-Cola Co. from the 1940s through the early 1960s.</p><p>The souvenir sheet artwork specifically is from 1963.</p><p>Other than the Coke bottle shown on the souvenir sheet selvage, there is no direct placement of Coca-Cola product on the stamps themselves.</p><p>A first-day ceremony for the Sparkling Holidays stamps will take place at 11:15 a.m. CDT Thursday at the Inn at Christmas Place, 119 Christmas Tree Lane, in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.</p><p>The double-sided pane has been available for pre-order from the U.S. Postal Service since Sept. 14, but an earlier USPS announcement that the souvenir sheet also would be available for early ordering was incorrect. The souvenir sheet will be available for ordering on the issue date.</p><p>The Postal Service describes the four stamps in the double-sided pane as featuring classic images of Santa Claus painted by famed commercial artist Haddon Sundblom.</p><p>“Each of the four images portraying a close-up of Santa’s face are details from larger paintings created by Sundblom and originally published in ads for The Coca-Cola Company from the 1940s through the early 1960s. Sundblom is the man credited with refining the modern image of Santa Claus. Art director Greg Breeding designed the stamps.”</p><p>According to a brief history of Sundblom’s work published by Coca-Cola, an advertising agency working with the Coca-Cola company in 1931 wanted a Christmas advertising campaign showing a wholesome Santa who was both realistic and symbolic.</p><p>With Clement Clark Moore’s 1822 poem A Visit from St. Nicholas as inspiration, Sundblom developed his image of the warm and friendly Santa that has been adopted internationally.</p><p>According to the Coca-Cola history: “From 1931 to 1964, Coca-Cola advertising showed Santa delivering toys (and playing with them!), pausing to read a letter and enjoy a Coke, visiting with the children who stayed up to greet him, and raiding the refrigerators at a number of homes.</p><p>The original oil paintings Sundblom created were adapted for Coca-Cola advertising in magazines and on store displays, billboards, posters, calendars and plush dolls. Many of those items today are popular collectibles.”</p><p>Sundblom’s original oil paintings are described by Coca-Cola as some of the most prized pieces in the art collection in the company archives. They have been exhibited in the Louvre in Paris and in other prominent museums around the world, and some of the paintings are displayed at the World of Coca-Cola, a multimedia attraction and exhibition in Atlanta, Ga.</p><p>The design of one of the four stamps in the double-sided pane is from the painting shown cropped on the souvenir sheet. While that stamp vignette, or central design, is similar to the souvenir sheet stamp, the “USA” and “Forever” inscriptions on the two stamps are in different positions.</p><p>The souvenir sheet stamp is semijumbo size, so it is slightly larger than the standard definitive size of the sparkling holidays stamps on the double-sided pane.</p><p>Using offset-lithography, Postal Service contract printer Ashton Potter USA has printed 1 million of the single-stamp souvenir sheets, and 1 billion stamps in the 20-stamps double-sided pane.</p><p>The Postal Service has prepared two first-day cancels, one in black and the other in color, with the words “Sparkling Holidays” featured prominently and surrounded with ornaments or holiday decor.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

The U.S. Postal Service celebrates that highly anticipated event with four new stamps.</p><p>The stamps tell the story of St. Nick’s visit on Christmas Eve. Illustrator Brad Woodard created his images by first sketching then digitizing them. There are four stamps that tell the story of Santa’s visit on Christmas Eve. The first stamp has Santa about to climb into a rooftop chimney, with the second showing his feet dangling over the fireplace hearth as he descends. A winking Santa graces the third stamp, while the fourth shows Santa and some of his reindeer as they travel on to their next stop.</p><p>St. Nick—Santa Claus—is one of our most recognized and beloved cultural icons, his jolly laugh and smiling eyes a happy reminder that the holidays are near. European immigrants brought to their new country folk characters that over the years became our present-day Santa Claus. One of those characters was Sinterklaas, who delivered presents on the eve of the feast day of St. Nicholas of Myra, a third-century bishop. In an 1809 satire, American author Washington Irving described a dream in which St. Nick traveled in a flying wagon. A few years later, in 1821, the illustrations accompanying the poem “The Children’s Friend” further embellished the legend with “Santeclaus” arriving in a sleigh drawn by a reindeer.</p><p>In 1823, the anonymous publication of the poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas,” perhaps better known as “The Night before Christmas,” helped to shape much of our modern mythology of the holiday. St. Nicholas’s sleigh is pulled by eight flying reindeer, each of them carefully called by name. Dressed in fur, with twinkling eyes, rosy cheeks, and dimples, St. Nick visits each home to fill children’s stockings with presents. He is described as a merry, plump elf—very different from the original rather somber bishop.</p><p>Twentieth-century artists based their illustrations of Santa Claus on some of Nast’s images, as well as on the description in the poem “The Night Before Christmas.” Their portrayals of a rosy-cheeked, smiling, grandfatherly man in his red, fur-trimmed suit seemed to embody the very essence of “Santa.” A visit from St. Nick brings joy to the kid in all of us.</p><p>Art director Greg Breeding designed the stamps with original art by Brad Woodard.</p><p>The <b><i>A Visit from St. Nick</i></b> stamps are being issued as Forever® stamps.

Inspired by folk art but with a modern graphic vibe, these charming designs will add a touch of whimsy to your holiday mailings.</p><p>Illustrator Kirsten Ulve used a traditional palette of red, green and white, and channeled her love of Christmas, vintage ornaments and Scandinavian folk art to create unique digital illustrations of four holiday icons: a prancing reindeer with antlers; an ornament tied with a bow and ready to hang; a tree topped with a star; and a stocking holding a teddy bear and a sprig of holly. “Forever” and “USA” appear along the stamp’s edge. Art director Antonio Alcalá was the stamp designer.</p><p>Holiday Delights will be available nationwide Sept 24. A virtual dedication ceremony will be posted on the Postal Service’s Facebook and Twitter pages.</p><p>“German immigrants brought the tradition of the indoor decorated tree to America. Early on, decorations included candles and homemade ornaments,” said Secretary of the Board of Governors Michael J. Elston, dedicating official for the Postal Service. “With these stamps, the Postal Service is capturing the vintage spirit of Christmas in hopes they will convey the joy of the season and bring to mind happy memories of Christmases past.”</p><p>Once the tradition of decorating trees caught on, in the 1890s, Woolworth’s five-and-dime stores began to import handblown ornaments. By the mid-20th century, Americans were buying hundreds of thousands of ornaments each Christmas.</p><p>The origin of hanging stockings is lost in myth, but according to legend, St. Nicholas heard of a widower who could not pay his daughters’ dowries. St. Nick dropped gold coins down the man’s chimney, and they landed in the girls’ stockings hung by the fireplace to dry.</p><p>Although there is no certainty about how reindeer originally came to be associated with the holiday, it could be that their natural habitat in northernmost Europe and North America fits perfectly with the story of Santa’s secret North Pole workshop.</p><p>The dedication location is connected with Christmas: Frankenmuth. It is the home of Bronner’s, the largest Christmas store in the world, and is a Bavarian-rooted town with lots of holiday-related activities.</p><p>News of the stamp is being shared with hashtags #HolidayDelightsStamp and #HolidayStamps.</p><p>Holiday Delights is being issued as a Forever stamp in booklets of 20.

stamp1046,2015 US Summer Harvest Booklet,2015 US Summer Harvest Booklet,"<p>On July 11, 2015, in Sacramento, CA, the U.S. Postal Service® will issue the Summer Harvest stamps (Forever® First-Class Mail® priced at 49 cents) in four designs, in a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) booklet of 20 stamps.</p><p>Every summer, some of America’s favorite foods are in season. The U.S. Postal Service celebrates a few of those favorites-corn, tomatoes, cantaloupes, and watermelons-with four new stamps. Vintage produce advertising, including 19th- and early 20th-century crate labels, seed packets, and catalogs, inspired these stamp designs.</p><p>Though not all produce was shipped in wooden crates, the stamp art is especially reminiscent of vintage crate labels. The four stylized labels are drawn in the same color palette of red, black, green, and yellow-orange. The produce names are in white lettering at the tops of the four stamps. The word “Forever” is enclosed in a banner centered along the bottom of the stamp; the letters “USA” are to the right of the banner.</p><p>After America’s railroads linked the East and West Coasts in the 1870s, growers in agricultural areas could ship their products to locations across the country. To distinguish their wares from other producers, growers commissioned special crate labels from printing houses that employed some of the day’s best graphic artists. The artists created designs that featured clever slogans and unusual styles, though the art did not necessarily relate to the produce inside.

Shot from above, the photograph shows the intricate design of the flower’s bloom.</p><p>Known as the “Queen of the Fall Flowers,” mums (as they are popularly called) are one of America’s favorite garden, cut, and container plants. First mentioned in Chinese literature as early as the 15th century B.C., chrysanthemums are members of the vast Asteraceae family.</p><p>The wild variety in China was a small yellow flower used in herbal remedies. Today there are hundreds of chrysanthemum cultivars. Among the many different types of chrysanthemum blooms are cushion, daisy, decorative, pompom, and spider. Chrysanthemum flowers come in many colors, including lime green, bronze, rust, maroon, white, yellow, and purple.</p><p>The fall-blooming chrysanthemum symbolizes joy and optimism in the face of the oncoming winter months, and the flowers are popular worldwide. Highly revered in Japan since the eighth century, the chrysanthemum is used on the seal and crest of the country’s emperor. Japan’s National Chrysanthemum Day, also called the Festival of Happiness, celebrates the beloved plant’s importance to Japanese culture.</p><p>In parts of the world, the flower is brewed into tea that is believed to remedy various ailments. According to the popular practice of feng shui—the art of creating harmony and balance within a surrounding environment—mums are believed to bring good luck to the home. Among Australians, chrysanthemums are the flower of choice for sending on Mother’s Day, which falls in May, an autumn month in the Southern Hemisphere. In the U.S., mums are November’s birth flower, and they are the official flower of the city of Chicago. They are also the flower designated to celebrate a 13th wedding anniversary.</p><p>The art director was William J. Gicker. Greg Breeding designed the stamp with an existing photograph by Hong Vo.</p><p>This Global Forever stamp can be used to mail a one-ounce letter to any country to which First-Class Mail International® service is available. As with all Global Forever stamps, this stamp will have a postage value equivalent to the price of the single-piece First-Class Mail International first-ounce machineable letter in effect at the time of use.

Stylized, decorated “sugar skulls” are personalized as four family members, one per stamp: a child with a hair bow, a father sporting a hat and mustache, a mother with curled hair, and another child. The lit candles flanking each sugar skull are beacons to guide deceased loved ones on their annual return journey to the land of the living. Dotting each stamp and adorning their shared vertical borders are marigolds (cempazuchitles), the most popular Day of the Dead flower. The vibrant colors of the flowers and other embellishments, along with the white of the sugar skulls, stand out brightly from the stamps’ black background.</p><p>With roots in pre-Columbian Latin America, Dia de los Muertos resulted from the meeting of Indigenous traditions and practices introduced by the Catholic missionaries who arrived with the Spanish colonizers in the late 1500s. The modern version of the holiday rose out of the activism of the 1970s, when Chicano artists in California saw it as a way to build pride in Mexican culture.</p><p>Today hundreds of thousands of Americans from all walks of life flock to celebrations hosted each November by museums, galleries, and community centers. They are drawn by the exuberant processions, skeleton costumes and face painting, music, dancing, special food, and arts-and-crafts workshops, and by the ofrendas honoring not only departed family members but also heroes and celebrities.</p><p>It is no wonder that Day of the Dead, with all its exuberant color, life-affirming joy, and appeal for the whole family, is fast becoming a popular American holiday.</p><p>Luis Fitch designed and illustrated the stamps.

The Year of the Ox begins February 12, 2021, and ends on January 31, 2022.</p><p>The ox mask in the stamp design incorporates elements with symbolic meaning. Several of the patterns were created with the style of Asian textiles in mind as well as purple flowers that represent the arrival of spring, which Lunar New Year also signals in Chinese culture. The star in the center of the ox’s head references the celestial themes of the Chinese zodiac. Orange foil was used to add emphasis to the crown atop the ox’s head.</p><p>The ox is the second of the 12 zodiac animal signs associated with the Chinese lunar calendar. Many ancient fables and legends explain the origin of the zodiac signs. The most common story tells of the animals racing across a river to determine their order in the cycle. The rat crossed by riding on the back of the ox, jumping ahead at the last minute to win the race, with the ox coming in second place.</p><p>As with other zodiac signs, personality traits and other attributes are often associated with people born in the year of a particular animal. Those born duringthe Year of the Ox may be seen as honest, diligent, and highly dependable. In Chinese tradition, five elements—wood, fire, earth, metal (or gold), and water—also cycle in accordance with the lunar calendar and are associated with the year’s animal sign. In 2021, the Lunar New Year will mark the beginning of the Year of the Gold Ox.</p><p>Lunar New Year is one of the most important holidays of the year for many Asian communities around the world and is primarily celebrated by people of Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tibetan, Mongolian, Malaysian, and Filipino heritage.

Mattel soon introduced its bright orange tracks, which provided children unlimited ways to test out stunts and racing skills. The Hot Wheels toy line expanded rapidly. Since the inception of Hot Wheels, Mattel has produced thousands of varieties of cars. In 2011, Hot Wheels was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame. Today, children and parents alike still love racing the eye-poppin’, colorful, lightning-fast cars.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

Blockbuster thrillers and sensationalized media have fueled the belief that sharks are monsters: unthinking, bloodthirsty, vengeful and primitive. While they are ancient creatures, having emerged long before the first dinosaurs, after 400 million years the 500 or so known shark species have adapted to their ecological role.</p><p>Sharks’ adaptations include light, flexible skeletons of cartilage, teeth replaced without limit and skin covered by a hydrodynamic surface of tiny tooth-like structures. Their keen senses include one that detects electrical signals given off by prey and enables navigation by Earth’s magnetic field. Their nervous systems are also adapted to sense miniscule water movements, such as the struggles of a far-off fish.</p><p>An athlete of the shark world is the swift, streamlined mako shark. The stamps image depicts a shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) knifing through the water near the surface.</p><p>The most distinctive feature of the pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus) is its unique, whip-like tail fin, seen trailing in the distance of the stamps image.</p><p>The world’s largest fish is the sluggish, filter-feeding, school bus-sized whale shark (Rhincodon typus).</p><p>The scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), featured in the hammerhead shark sstamps, is one of three large hammerhead species.</p><p>This issuance celebrates the wonder of sharks with a pane of 20 stamps featuring realistic images of five species that inhabit American waters: mako shark, represented here by a shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus); thresher shark, here a pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus); great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias); whale shark (Rhincodon typus); and hammerhead shark, this one a scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini).

Each stamp in the block of four includes an illustration of one of these flowers: a purple pasqueflower; an orange-red wood lily; a bright yellow alpine buttercup; and a dark pink Woods’ rose.</p><p>The artist’s hand-drawn illustrations, refined digitally, create a block-print aesthetic. The color and shape of each flower was selected for its unique beauty and to complement the block of four.</p><p>An important part of the natural world, wildflower habitats support species from butterflies and bees to birds and foraging mammals. Wildflowers grow in varied environments, including bogs and swamps, forests and woodlands, alpine meadows, mountain slopes, and coastal bluffs—even deserts. Some wildflowers are widely distributed across the United States, while others are specific to just a small area.</p><p>Pasqueflower <i>(Anemone patens)</i> is distributed in the western and central U.S. It grows on mountain slopes and meadows as well as on prairie grasslands. One of the earliest blooming wildflowers, the common name pasque refers to Easter or Passover, when the flowers first begin to appear.</p><p>Woods’ rose <i>(Rosa woodsii)</i> is native to parts of the western and central U.S. and blooms in late spring through July on stony slopes and in mountain forests, among other habitats. This fast-growing, long-lived perennial plant forms dense thickets of thorny shrubs that can reach 10 feet in height.</p><p>Wood lily <i>(Lilium philadelphicum)</i> is a red or red-orange, summer-blooming flower. The native plant grows in many habitats, including mountain meadows in western states and the grassland prairies of the Great Plains. It is rarer in the eastern part of the country. The bulbs were once gathered for food by Native Americans.</p><p>Alpine buttercup <i>(Ranunculus adoneus)</i> is one of more than 330 species of the Ranunculaceae family that bloom in the U.S. The flowers appear in spring in mountain meadows near the edge of melting snows and continue to bloom into summer. The native plant is found in several western states.</p><p>Wildflowers, like many garden flowers, can have several common names; they can even share common names with unrelated plants. Botanical names are also frequently in flux as scientists learn more about the characteristics of each plant and reclassify them. As of the date these stamps were issued, the names, common and scientific, were accurate.</p><p>Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamps with original art by Lili Arnold.</p><p>The <strong><i>Mountain Flora</i></strong> stamps are being issued in booklets of 20 and coils of 3,000 and 10,000 Forever® stamps.

The word “BIRTHDAY” appears below it in blue, with “Forever” and “USA” centered in smaller red lettering at the bottom. Surrounding all of the design elements is a flurry of multicolored ribbons and confetti.</p><p>The celebration of birthdays in the United States has its origins in a wide array of cultural traditions. Some ancient civilizations observed the birthdays of prominent figures or celebrated rites of passage, and well-wishes and gifts have long been associated with bringing about good fortune. Folklorists and historians claim to see the origins of birthday parties in older practices that resemble our customs, such as candles on a cake, which existed in some form in both ancient Greece and early modern Germany. When we gather to sing, brighten our spirits with candles, and make a wish, these deeply rooted rituals connect us to loved ones and invite everyone to share in the birthday fun.</p><p>This stamp was designed by Lisa Catalone Castro and Rodolfo Castro, with artwork by Rodolfo Castro.

Say “thank you” in style with four new stamps.</p><p>Highlighted in gold foil are the words “Thank you” in cursive script and an elegant floral design that swirls through and around the words. Dana Tanamachi, the stamp designer and lettering artist, drew the original sketches for the calligraphy by hand and then created the final art digitally. She added floral elements to the swirls, which resemble vines. Inspired by penmanship from the past, she created an elegant, flowing script that is classic yet fresh and modern, evoking a sense of connection and gratitude. Each of the four stamps features one of these background colors: blue gray, purple, muted green, and soft maroon.</p><p>One of the most thoughtful ways to express gratitude is to send a handwritten note declaring a heartfelt “thank you.” Taking the time to commit words of thanks to paper is a ritual that elevates the act of appreciation and gratifies both the recipient and the sender. A few sentences are all that is needed.</p><p>Today, there is a renewed awareness of the importance of offering gratitude. Recently published books, websites, and online video tutorials deliver instructions on how to write a note of thanks, and in the process, they have revived an almost lost art.</p><p>These elegant and joyful stamps will add visual appeal to notes, cards, and letters of thanks sent to acknowledge a favor, an act of kindness, or a job well done or to express thanks for gifts sent for any occasion including birthdays, graduations, holidays, and weddings.</p><p>Greg Breeding was the art director.</p><p>The <strong><i>Thank You</i></strong> stamps will be issued as Forever® stamps in panes of 20.

stamp1063,2020 US Hanukkah Sheet,2020 US Hanukkah Sheet,"<p>Families come together each year to celebrate Hanukkah, the joyous Jewish holiday also called the Festival of Lights.</p><p>The story of Hanukkah—“dedication” in Hebrew—tells of reclaiming the Temple in Jerusalem, which had been desecrated by a conquering army. Worshippers prepared to rededicate the holy space but discovered that only one small jar of consecrated oil remained, enough to last one day. Rather than wait for more oil to arrive, they lit the Temple menorah, which burned for eight days. This miracle of the oil is celebrated during Hanukkah with the ceremonial lighting of the hanukiah, the nine-branched menorah used during the holiday.</p><p>The stamp art’s colorful digital illustration shows the lighting of the hanukiah on the last evening of Hanukkah. Artist Jing Jing Tsong chose her colors intentionally to evoke Hanukkah traditions as seen through the eyes of children. The darker blue colors in the background symbolize winter, while the brightly colored flaming candles reflect the spirit and warmth of sharing the holiday traditions.</p><p>Hanukkah is a family-centered celebration, particularly the lighting of the hanukiah. The family gathers to recite blessings each night, one before the lighting and one as the candles are lit; a third blessing, known as the Shehecheyanu, is recited or sung only on the first night of the festival just as it is on other special family occasions. The candle for the first night is put on the far right side of the hanukiah. On each subsequent night, an additional candle is placed to the immediate left of the previous night’s candle—right to left, the direction in which Hebrew is read. The candles are then lit from left to right, so that the lighting begins with the newest candle. Some families take this opportunity to explain more about their heritage and the symbolism behind the ritual.</p><p>After the lighting of the candles, families might play games, host a sing-along of favorite Hanukkah tunes, or prepare and eat fried foods traditionally consumed during the holiday.</p><p>In 2021, Hanukkah begins on the evening of November 28.</p><p>Art director Ethel Kessler designed the stamp with original art by Tsong.</p><p>The <strong><i>Hanukkah</i></strong> stamp is being issued as a Forever® stamp.

stamp1065,2017 US Snowy Day Booklet,2017 US Snowy Day Booklet,"<p>The United States Postal Service will issue four forever stamps Oct. 4 reproducing scenes from Ezra Jack Keats’ classic children’s book, The Snowy Day.</p><p>The story of Peter, the boy in the red snowsuit, is summed up in the publisher’s blurb on the book’s dust-jacket flap: “The quiet fun and sweetness of this small boy’s small adventures in the deep, deep snow have the true quality of all childhood’s delight in contented solitude. Beautiful spacious pictures and just the right number of the right words tell a story to love and remember.”</p><p>Published in 1962, The Snowy Day won the Randolph Caldecott Medal the following year for the most distinguished picture book for children.</p><p>Participating in the ceremony will be Linda E. Johnson, the Brooklyn Public Library president and CEO; children’s author Andrea Davis Pinkney, who wrote A Poem for Peter, The Story of Ezra Jack Keats and the Creation of The Snowy Day; Deborah Pope, executive director of the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation; and Roderick N. Sallay, USPS government relations and public policy acting director.</p><p>In A Poem for Peter, Pinkney said, “As an African American child growing up in the 1960s, at a time when I didn’t see others like me in children’s books, I was profoundly affected by the expressiveness of Keats’s illustrations.”</p><p>The Snowy Day Stamps are being issued in a double-sided pane of 20, with five of each design. The first design shows Peter forming a snowball to put in his pocket to keep for the next day. In the second design, he is sliding down a “heaping mountain of snow.” The third stamp depicts Peter making a snow angel, and the fourth shows the tracks he made while crunching through the snow with his toes pointing in.</p><p>Keats (1916-83), the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, grew up in Brooklyn, excelling at art at a young age. Although he received scholarships to attend art school, he worked to support his family instead (his father had died a day before Keats’ high school graduation in 1935).</p><p>His jobs during the Depression included working as a mural artist for the WPA (Works Progress Administration) and as an illustrator of backgrounds for the Captain Marvel comics. Also, according to Keats’ biography on the website of the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation, he designed camouflage patterns while serving in the Army during World War II.</p><p>After the war, he studied art in Paris and then returned to New York to work as a commercial artist.</p><p>He began illustrating children’s books in the 1950s, and co-wrote and illustrated My Dog is Lost in 1960.</p><p>The Snowy Day came two years later, but the inspiration of  the snowy day stamps for the character of Peter originated two decades earlier when Keats saw a series of black-and-white photographs in Life magazine of an African-American boy in Georgia reacting to a blood test.</p><p>Keats also tried new artistic techniques in the book. The Ezra Jack Keats Foundation said that a “collage with cutouts of patterned paper, fabric and oilcloth; homemade snowflake stamps; spatterings of India ink with a toothbrush — were methods Ezra had never used before.”</p><p>In addition to other awards and recognition, The Snowy Day was listed on the Library of Congress’ online exhibit “Books That Shaped America”. This listing honors The Snowy Day as the “first full-color picture book with an African-American as the main character.”</p><p>Among the more than 20 other books that Keats would write for children, six of them featured Peter. One of these, A Letter to Amy, even has a postal theme, showing Peter writing a party invitation and then venturing out in a storm to mail it. After he finished his invitation, Peter said, “Now I’ll mail it,” and his mother reminded him, “Put on a stamp.”</p><p>“The Snowy Day,” will be showcased in this set of four stamps. Written and illustrated by the children’s author, Ezra Jack Keats, it was one of the first prominent 20th-century picture books centered on an African-American child. Each of the four new stamps in this booklet features a different illustration of main character Peter exploring and playing in his neighborhood while wearing his red snowsuit.

stamp1066,2011 US Wedding CELEBRATE Sheet,2011 US Wedding CELEBRATE Sheet,"<p>In 2011, in Cleveland, Ohio, the Postal Ser­vice issued a Neon Celebrate! special Forever Stamp, in one design in a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) pane of 20 stamps. The stamp was designed by Phil Jordan, Falls Church, Virginia.</p><p>The stamp design is similar to the Neon Celebrate forever stamp issued March 25, 2011, but the “Forever” and “USA” inscriptions, which appear in the upper left and right corners of the 2011 stamp, have been moved to the lower half of the stamp on the new issue.</p><p>Inspired by a visit to the Museum of Neon Art in Los Angeles, Art Director Phil Jordan began to think about the possibility of using neon to depict a stamp subject. He decided that a “Neon Celebrate!” stamp, with its imagery of vivid colors, fit the bill. The black background of the stamp is reminiscent of a night sky. Like a fireworks display on a summer evening, brilliantly colored images of swirls, cir­cles, and dashes in pink, blue, orange, yellow, and green seem to erupt from the ground to illuminate the darkness. Each letter of the word “Celebrate” and the exclamation point that is part of this stamp’s official title, are highlighted in bright white light.</p><p>The stamp was designed by USPS art director Phil Jordan, working with neon artist Michael Flechtner of Van Nuys, Calif.</p><p>Around the world, celebrations are a time for family and friends to come together to honor many happy occasions. From birthdays and anniversaries to new jobs and well-deserved retirements, celebrations are a time of joy and togetherness.</p><p>Jordan selected fine-artist Michael Flechtner to design America’s first neon stamp. Flechtner found his inspiration for the stamp in a fireworks display, noting that “…fireworks, with all their color, light, and motion, was the embodiment of a celebration.”</p><p>Forever stamps will always be equal in value to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce price.</p><h2>Shipping Info</h2><p>The Cheap Stamp Shop® ships all in-stock orders with USPS Tracking® service.

Similar in design to the two-ounce <strong><i>Sunflower Bouquet</i></strong> stamp also issued in 2022, this Forever® stamp can be used on RSVP envelopes often enclosed with wedding invitations. In addition to regular correspondence, it is also perfect for party invitations, thank-you notes, and important announcements.</p><p>The stamp features a colorful array of tulips against a bright white background. To create this image, the photographer backlit a wide, horizontal arrangement of flowers on a light box. Since this composition was wider than his camera could photograph at high resolution, he made three separate images, moving from left to right. Each image was exposed six times at different exposure values. He digitally combined the resulting eighteen captures to form a single image.</p><p>From their origins as a wildflower in central Asia, tulips have been cultivated around the world for centuries. Now grown in innumerable variations of color, size, and petal shape, they are considered an appropriate flower for virtually any occasion. Featuring a luminous, almost ethereal assortment of overlapping tulips in red, orange, yellow, purple, and white, this stamp is intended to lift the spirits of anyone who sees it on an envelope.</p><p>The stamp was designed by art director Ethel Kessler, with digital photography by Harold Davis.</p><p>The <strong><i>Tulips</i></strong> stamp is being issued as a Forever stamp.

stamp1069,US 2021 Colorado Hairstreak Sheet,US 2021 Colorado Hairstreak Sheet,"<p>The Colorado hairstreak butterfly graces the eighth non-machineable butterfly stamp for use on irregularly sized envelopes, such as square greeting cards, invitations, or announcements.</p><p>The stamp art was digitally created using images of preserved butterflies as a starting point. The result is a highly stylized, simplified image of a Colorado hairstreak rather than an exact replica.</p><p>The shimmering purple Colorado hairstreak butterfly (<i>Hypaurotis crysalus</i>) dwells in the forest canopy of that state and much of the Southwest. Never venturing far from its host plant, the Gambel oak (<i>Quercus gambelii</i>), it feeds on tree sap and fallen raindrops.</p><p>The Colorado hairstreak – Colorado’s official state insect – has slender, hair-like, hind-wing appendages that resemble antennae. Nearby, on the underside of the wings, are spots that look like eyes and the thin streaks that give the hairstreak its name. Pointing its abdomen upward with false antennae held high, the butterfly’s evolutionary decoys fool predators into attacking the false head on the wing. A hungry bird ends up with an unsatisfying beakful of scaly wing.</p><p>In autumn, after mating, the female lays her eggs. The plump, green caterpillar hatches in spring and feeds on tender new oak leaves. After metamorphosis, the Colorado hairstreak butterfly, with a wingspan of about 1<sup>1/2</sup> inches, darts in and out of the tree branches in quick, erratic flight.</p><p>The square format of the stamp was developed in partnership with the greeting card industry specifically for oversized or square envelopes. These envelopes cannot pass through the automated Postal processing system and have to be hand-cancelled. They are charged a non-machineable surcharge even if they weigh less than one ounce. Greeting card envelopes printed with a silhouette of a butterfly indicate the need for additional postage or the use of a butterfly stamp. Any non-machineable envelope, like oddly shaped or vertical envelopes, as well as lumpy envelopes, rigid envelopes, or mail with clasps, ribbons, or buttons, may use this stamp.</p><p><b><i>Colorado Hairstreak</i></b> is available in sheets of twenty. The words “NON-MACHINEABLE SURCHARGE” on the stamp indicate its usage value. Like a Forever® stamp, this stamp will always be valid for the rate printed on it.</p><p>Nationally known artist Tom Engeman created the stamp art.
